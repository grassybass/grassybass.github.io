## Game Introduction

Boba Boba is a hypercasual mobile game aimed at emulating the fun of sucking your favourite bobas in a typical boba milk tea. The goal is to gain as much points as possible by sucking various bobas that grants different amount of points, before the timer, indicated by the milk tea level, runs out. There are also certain bobas that would grant powerups such as:
  - Increase score multiplier
  - Transform some bobas into a stronger variant
  - Refill milktea and bobas
  - Grant huge amount of points
There's also a Fever meter that would increases as player sucks more bobas, which would double the points gained during the period.


## The Story

Just before wearing a mask going out was a thing, we designer was tasked to come up with ideas for hypercasual games. I saw that boba milk tea was the rave, and a huge amount of boba milk tea franchise / shops just sprang up like mushrooms. Seeing the chance, I proceeded to propose such an idea.
