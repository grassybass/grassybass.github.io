## First BIG Title on Roblox

After working on several smaller projects on Roblox, <abbr title="The Gang Stockholm">TGS</abbr> asked us, <abbr title="The Gang Asia">TGA</abbr> to RND a big title on Roblox platform with some guidance.

For this project, we were being assigned with a Producer, Eric, who is from the States. Despite the time difference, he would more often than not attend the weekly meeting to discuss the direction of the game with us. While the initial process is on the slower side, we were managed to come up with a finalized Game Design Document after some time.

The game was initially aimed to be a mix of shooter and <abbr title="You can't really do this on Roblox, since you need to set a maximum server size, and if it's too high, the latency would suffer">MMORPG</abbr> with high octane actions, with our reference games being The Legend of Zelda: BotW/TotK, Risk of Rain 2, Hunt: Showdown, as well as Dauntless.

## The Challenges - Vertical slice

Soon, the team members would be busy juggling with other minor projects of higher priority. Eventually, we were suddenly told to come up with a vertical slice within 2 months, with only two programmers. To meet the dateline, one of the unique selling point involving boss battles in shrines were canned, and we had to use some premade assets.

In this 2 month, each of the development team members would be busy with our own tasks. We would scour the internet for suitable monsters asset packs, terrains, as well as coming up with the designation of the monsters and their behaviour. I was also tasked to calculate and adjust the amount of <abbr title="Number of Worlds, Zones, Guns, Monsters, Bosses, Loots">contents</abbr> on the fly, depending on the available of resources at the time.

While what we ended up wasn't technically a vertical slice, but more of a demo, I can say that we've done a pretty good job given the time frame. And thus we have another 3 months until the project would be published.

## The Challenges 2 - Production

With the main selling point getting canned, we've decided that we would need to at least nail down the feeling of shooting all sorts of sci-fi guns. This phase began with the expansion of the original map to accomodate more monsters, so that players wouldn't find themselves constantly having to killsteal (ks) or being ks'ed. Under my guidance, me and an artist managed to expand the map with a few more POIs here and there, and made sure the view looking from the non-combat POIs would have a nice view with leading lines highlighting the next goal / POI.
