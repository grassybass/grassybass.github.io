# a summary about you
summary: |
      … with over 7 years of experience in crafting polished games with fun mechanics and engaging monetization strategies. Throughout the years I had the oppoturnity to lead or co-design several amazing titles with Unity on mobile platform, most notably, Ejen Ali: Emergency, Ejen Ali: Agents’ Arena, Komuniti Kita, and recently, Titan Heroes, on Roblox platform.
      
      I am adept at writing Game Design Documents and crafting formulae on Google Sheet to simulate and balance the game progression, while working closely with programmers, artists, and producer and come up with seamless solutions for any difficulties, be it technical, time constraint, or engagement / retention KPIs.
      
      During my free time I also like to tinker with technological stuff such as running nginx and some tools via Docker container over Hyper-V, with my own domain with SSL set up on Cloudflare. I also run my main email account over a catch-all vanity domain for privacy reasons. For security part, I use a password manager and set up 2FA with YubiKeys whenever possible.
